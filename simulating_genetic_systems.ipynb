For example, here’s a [diagram](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/analyzing-regulatory-networks-in-bacteria-14426192) showing interactions between genes in the bacterium E. coli. Different genes can interact in many ways. For example, gene A could either upregulate or downregulate gene B by affecting transcription, modifying DNA at B’s genetic locus, altering splicing, interacting in one of many possible ways with protein B, or interacting with some other gene that directly or indirectly regulates B. Evolution doesn’t care about making systems simple and engineerable—it’s just a blind process that produces systems with an immense amount of organic complexity. Understanding end engineering these complexities is what makes synthetic biology so tricky but also so powerful. See this [blog post ](https://medium.com/@thestephencasper/why-biology-is-hard-4ac393bfad8e)of mine for more info. \n","\n","However, simple models can be very useful. It’s common to see diagrams like [this](https://www.spandidos-publications.com/article_images/ijo/48/6/IJO-48-06-2367-g05.jpg). Here, pointed arrows indicate activation, and blunted arrows indicate repression. We can improve a model like this by replacing the boxes with diagrams showing parts of the genes (promoter, enhancer, reading frames, RBS’s, terminators, rna, proteins, etc.) or writing in details of their interaction or experimentally-verified equations for how they interact. \n","\n","A huge part of synthetic biology involves designing and tuning sets of interacting genes in order to have them expressed in a certain, novel ways over time. Here we’ll take the difficult task of integrating real biological parts into systems for granted and assume that we can engineer three genes, A, B, and C that have *any* rates of production, degradation, and positive or negative regulation between them. \n","\n","## The Activity ##\n","Given this simple notebook in Python, a powerful and common programming language, you will see how it simulates dynamics between three genes, and you will tune parameters in order to make the system display various properties\n","\n","No previous coding experience whatsoever is necessary!\n","\n","Now let’s walk through the code!

This will allow us to represent the levels of expression of each gene as a function of time. Next, it initializes a vector called *init* giving the initial expression levels of A, B, and C, respectively. \n","\n","Then the code defines a function called *dydt* that, on input a vector with each gene’s expression level and time, gives the derivative of each gene’s expression at that time. If you aren’t familiar with calculus, derivative essentially means slope. The slope of each gene’s expression as a function of *t* is given by the production level of that gene times an exponential term to the power of the combined values for activation/repression of that gene minus the current expression level times the degradation coefficient at time *t*. Notice that the change in a gene's expression at a certain time does not depend on the time--only on the current concentrations of the genes and the parameters. Also notice how some terms are written in the form *y\\[number\\]*. That’s how you access different elements of a list in python, and you start counting at zero instead of one. \n","\n","Finally, this code runs the simulation by passing the derivative function, initial conditions, and time vector into an integration function called *odeint*. Then it extracts the values of A, B, and C over time by creating three empty lists with the suffix *values* and looping over each timepoint to get the expression of each gene at each time. Finally, it plots the expression levels over time.

If one gene activates itself or another with too high a coefficient, the values will grow exponentially, exceed Python’s ability to represent large numbers, and give you a plot that makes no sense.**\n","\n","1. **Steady state (SS) analysis:** to start out, pick one of the genes, and set the **production** and **degradation** values to any small positive numbers (they should never be negative for this simulation).

What do you notice?\n","\n","3. **Slow approach to SS:** Now do the opposite with this gene. What do you notice?\n","\n","4. **Toggle switch:** Now let’s start using two genes. Set the parameters for two of them so that if one is expressed highly, the other is expressed lowly.

Hint: base this off of your 2-gene pulse generator.\n","\n","7. **Oscillator:** Now can you get the three genes to oscillate in their expression?
