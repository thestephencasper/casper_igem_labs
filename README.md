# casper_igem_labs
Computer science labs used for the Havard iGEM club.
There's not a ton to explain as far as instructions go. Each lab contains basic, well-commented code and instructions in its respective notebook. The simulating genetic systems lab is good for learning about genetic circuits, genetic parts, and dynamical systems. The data processing and ML lab is helpful for introductions to working with data and sklearn.
